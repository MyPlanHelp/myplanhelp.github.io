            If you do not have a MyPlan in progress, there will be a button to 'Start New My Plan'. Hit that button to start your new MyPlan. If you a MyPlan that is not yet completed, this button will not show up. If you have existing MyPlans, you will see a list of MyPlans with the most recent one at the top. Click on a MyPlan to bring up all four weeks. If you have completed a week, you can click on it to review your responses. If you have not yet completed it, clicking on a week will bring up the survey for you to respond.

        <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
        <p>Issue: I cannot see the Start New My Plan button</p>
        <p>Check that you do not have a MyPlan that is not completed. If you do not have any in-progress MyPlans, try refreshing or reloading the app.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Issue: The next week is not available even after I completed the previous week.</p>
        <p>Check that the previous week displays responses when you select it. If it does not, your responses were not submitted. If your responses are visible, refresh or reload the app.</p>
